Content: <p>I realize this is an old topic, but a follow-on question Iâ€™d have to this is:</p>
<p>If I have a small problem that can fit on one node, is it generally better to use something like OpenMP, vs. using MPI?  Would OpenMP have less overhead than MPI? Once you go beyond one node, my understanding is that you must use MPI.</p>
